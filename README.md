Todo list project. This project was kind of fail for me, I didn't spend enough time planning and later on that really showed. I wanted to implement inheritance + prototypes, but I didn't find a good use for them. Having said all that, I will be coming back to this project in the future, reworking it with newfound knowledge. The project itself wasn't that bad, I really liked it, it's my approach that was bad, and I hope I improve on this in the future. I used the built-in drag-and-drop api for dragging + dropping todo tabs
